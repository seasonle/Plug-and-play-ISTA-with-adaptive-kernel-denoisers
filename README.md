### Plug-and-play ISTA with adaptive-kernel denoisers

This is a Matlab implementation of the PnP-ISTA algorithm used in the following paper:

Tingting Liu, Le Xing and Zhonggui Sun, "Study on convergence of plug-and-play ISTA with adaptive-kernel denoisers".


### Usage
Run the file 'pnp_adptive_inpainting.m' to run a demo of image inpainting using plug-and-play ISTA with adaptive-kernel NLM.

Tested on Matlab 9.6.0 (R2018b).

### Credits
